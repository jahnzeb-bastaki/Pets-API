# Pets-API
A REST API with CRUD operations that uses golang, gin, mongoDB, and godotenv to keep track of informations about various pets.

Used Demola Maloma's article (https://dev.to/hackmamba/build-a-rest-api-with-golang-and-mongodb-gin-gonic-version-269m) to understand how to create a REST API and modified it to my specifications.
